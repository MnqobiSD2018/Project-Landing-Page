# A work in Progress ⚒️

A landing page i did from the Odin project without any assistance from AI just the old way of googling running through forums and so on. This took me 4 hours to make such a page.
The page works but is *NOT* fully responsive the hero doesn't adjust properly. i think i know the solution but because of the amount of time spent here i am delay even more learning.
